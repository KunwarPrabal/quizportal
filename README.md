# Quiz-Portal-for-MNNIT
This quiz portal will be used for conducting quizes and practical exams by teacher of any department. The quiz portal would reduce the work load on the teachers and evaluation of the students would be fair and unbiased. The portal would also help in conducting quizes in timely manner with no possibility of use of unfair means. The students can also check their marks and if they have any problem with the evaluation , they can also submit a discrepancy request. The teacher would have the record of each student and every quiz conducted by him which will be maintained in his database.

## Instruction

the files given in the folder "Add to dist folder in your project" to that dist folder and you are all set.

give the test and their data and result will be stored directly in the file.

6.) A timer will show how much time is left for the test.

7.) Automatic submit feature is there when the timer stops. So information and marks of all students will be saved even if they do not 
press the submit button.

8.) The test page will have buttons linking to each question generated dynamically. For example - If you have 20 questions in the
quiz, then 20 buttons will be automatically generated.

9.) Student can navigate between questions using the buttons.

10.) When student saves one answer, the colour of the respective button will change to "Green" indicating that the student has already
submitted this question. This way the student can easily keep track of the questions he answered and the ones he didn't.

11.) Password reser feature is there if teacher wants to reset his password.
